#USER# Is it true that Fredo‚Äôs brother is in Lolita Express pilot logs?
#USER# #USER# #USER# So was Epstein‚Äôs prison cell
#USER# A federal prison the AG is ultimately responsible for
#USER# If this didn‚Äôt come from highest levels, there would have been arrests by now.
#USER# Are you freaking serious?!? He protected those murdering Clintons for 8 years!!
#USER# Democrats are wicked and Republicans are largely scared. Wicked usually wins that fight

#USER# Karma for calling 63 million Americans racist every night for 3 years.
#USER# #USER# Should have been arrests by now
#USER# Guess who has a new name

#USER# #USER# How about Cuomo calling 63 million Americans racist?
#USER# He calls half the country racist and then is insulted by being called Fredo?
#USER# #USER# And Ross‚Äôs decision to hold a fundraiser for Trump?
#USER# There are words and there are actions. So far, Barr is no different than Sessions
#USER# #USER# And Republicans just seem to keep letting them do it
#USER# As he supports #USER#
#USER# And the hotel owner was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù that gambling was going on in his establishment.
#USER# Where is AG??? Firings and arrests should have happened already
#USER# #USER# They don‚Äôt care about how stupid people are, only that they can get away with it.
#USER# And I view Kenny Stills differently since he started kneeling. Now what?
#USER# #USER# #USER# Don King called and wants his hair back
#USER# Echoes of what happened to Kenneth Michael Trentadue while in federal custody and Holder was DAG.
#USER# #USER# Where is AG? #HASHTAG#
#USER# #USER# Nothing will happen
#USER# Which one has the most deep state allies? For the record, Clintons have the dirt on Barr
#USER# Barr won‚Äôt do a damn thing
#USER# #USER# How was Epstein allowed to kill himself? Rather than answer, conspiracy reality deniers scream conspiracy theory
#USER# 1.) how disgusting the theaters are after use 2.) similar experience at home with large, hi def screens 3.) not many good movies
#USER# Defend Clinton and his 26 confirmed trips on Lolita Express, many of which with multiple underage girls, doofus.
#USER# And he still only had one catch for 6 yards. When I think about that pick, I Get Sicki
So Epstein killed on a Friday night. Interesting timing on top of other flags.
#USER# #USER# Bush was a turd. Legacy aging like a bad wine. Please don‚Äôt invoke his name.
Those who call you a conspiracy theorist if you say Epstein was murdered are conspiracy reality deniers.
#USER# Perhaps he just demanded that he not be framed by those who report to him.
#USER# Aliens fly by earth and lock their doors.
#USER# #USER# And then what?
#USER# Barr is Compromised. #HASHTAG# #URL#
#USER# Where is Barr?
#USER# And Clinton was on his plane 26 times with underage girls
#USER# If the feds wanted him protected, he would have been
#USER# #USER# Conspiracy Reality Erickson, who destroyed his own career via TDS
#USER# #USER# His cell was under 24 hour video surveillance, right?
#USER# #USER# More Q-Bot crap
#USER# #USER# #USER# Anyone got a photo of a pregnant Michelle Obama (18 months of her life) to end the conjecture?
#USER# #USER# #USER# Barr should be VETTED by conservatives, not given benefit of the doubt. #HASHTAG#
#USER# #USER# #USER# He‚Äôs not. Here‚Äôs why: #HASHTAG# #URL#
#USER# #USER# Biden is creepy but without audio, all speculation
#USER# So why did you side with Huma Abedin over #USER# ?
#USER# #USER# Barr is part of the problem because he is so severely COMPROMISED. #HASHTAG# #URL#
#USER# And Republicans have ignored Muslim Brotherhood for years. None joined #USER# when she rightly called out Huma
#USER# #USER# Oh look, a Secretary of Defense who wouldn‚Äôt even defend his own wife.
#USER# #USER# Mitch didn‚Äôt seem to care
#USER# #USER# And Barr... does nothing. #HASHTAG#
#USER# #USER# Oh look, another tree fell in the woods with no one around to hear it.
#USER# He is such a disingenuous and opportunistic pos
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Obama and Hillary 1a and 1b in no particular order
#USER# While correct, it backfired on them so I still use it. What will u call it?
#USER# Looks like auditions for Pallywood
#USER# You‚Äôre a Q-bot??? Sheesh
#USER# #USER# #HASHTAG# Only fools trust #USER# after all he‚Äôs done
#USER# So stills should be allowed to exercise free speech and Ross should not?
#USER# In my view, Obama divided this country more than any other president in US history and it has nothing to do with skin color.
#USER# #USER# Tolerance in action #URL#
#USER# #USER# When asked if any indictments, Graham said: #URL#
#USER# He should produce them
#USER# Makes more sense than the 8/8 guy
#USER# #USER# #USER# Conservative media just gives Barr a pass and just keeps wondering why there are no indictments.
#USER# And when #USER# asked if there WILL be indictments, not ONE person said yes.
#USER# #USER# And when asked if there would be indictments, Graham said nothing
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Why don‚Äôt you vet AG Barr???? #URL#
#USER# And where is AG? #HASHTAG#
#USER# #USER# And Barr gave him a pass
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Perhaps Blagojevich has some dirt on Obama.
#USER# #USER# #USER# Where is AG? #HASHTAG#
#USER# You‚Äôre on the side of Deep State, doofus. Does it sponsor your show?
#USER# That‚Äôs why we have the 10th amendment (before it was neutered by the 17th)

#USER# #USER# That sounds nice...in theory. No woman wants a man who's inept in the bedroom.
#USER# Appreciate that sir. üôè
#USER# Thanks for the feedback. I'm happy to break these down for you in the coming days. Great questions.
#USER# Oh you teach men how to dominate the dating world huh? üëçüòÜ #URL#

#USER# What betting platform are you using?
#USER# Yep. I give a broad one chance and that's all. Don't need anyone around me who feels entitled to what I give.
#USER# Change "few" to one, maaaaaybe two at the most. Three and it's time to leave that woman be.
RT #USER#: A woman shouldn't be used to validate a man's existence, but rather, to enhance it.#USER#
#USER# It's what I do brother.
This is much closer than I had expected. Interesting...
#USER# #USER# I like how you worded that.
Does paying for sex make you a trick?

#USER# They hate to hear this, but it's just like training a dog. What's different?
#USER# I just don't ask. The severally used ones usually give themselves away though.
#USER# If you have your womans mind then the body will follow.
#USER# Definitely the younger the better. Older women are harder to manage. More baggage to deal with...or not.
#USER# Be clear with your intentions. Don't let her initiate a relationship you don't want.
#USER# Sounds like a winner to me. üëå
#USER# #USER# Lose your adrenaline?
